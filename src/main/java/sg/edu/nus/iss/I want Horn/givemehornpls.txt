Rita Skamandros, codenamed "Horn," is the daughter of the famous "White Wolf Count" and hails from an ancient lineage of Victorian nobles who once served the Aslan Padishah of Sargon.She serves as the lieutenant of the 7th Frontline Infantry Battalion and the leader of the 2nd Tempest Platoon, the regiment where Fiona, a.k.a. "Bagpipe", belongs to. A strict yet reliable leader, Horn makes herself a walking armored artillery with her shield-cannon. Rita was thought to be missing following the atrocity at County Hillock, but she turns out to be held hostage by Mandragora until Misery's team rescued her. Now joined with the rest of the Victorian army, Bagpipe, and Rhodes Island, she is ready to strike back against both Dublinn and the Kazdelian occupants at the palace of Londinium and stop the activation of the Shard.
